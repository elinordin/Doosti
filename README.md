Hyper Island - Design for the user module - 1.5 day assignment.


### :scroll: Brief:
Create a website based on your classmate's passion company. Base your design upon questions to your friend nailing down what he/she wants the user to feel.


### :hourglass: Time spent:
15 days.


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
Have a website and design to deliver, practice making fast decisions.


### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:
When asking questions to my classmate we discussed the purpose and target audience of the company, which is young adventurous adults in Afghanistan. The business is meant to be a crossing between couchsurfing and tripadvisor and the final purpose is to increase the speed of peace by closing the gap between different ethnic groups in Afghanistan and making young people eager to travel their own country.


### :closed_book: Learnings:

* I am able to make fast decisions when needed
* Sometimes good decisions doesn't have to take time
* The paradox of choice - I don't need to try 20 different fonts, 5 is probably enough to make a good decision
* Prototyping takes a lot more time for me than the actual coding
* The power of NUF - Questions. NAIL the scope of the project, UNDERSTAND my role, what do we want the user to FEEL
